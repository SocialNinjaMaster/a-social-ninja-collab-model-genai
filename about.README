# A Social Ninja Collab Model - GenAI

## Project Overview
This project aims to create a revolutionary query-to-prompt-to-text-to-video response system using a Large Language Model (LLM). The goal is to provide a highly accurate and engaging response system that can generate informative video content from text queries.
